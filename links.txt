this is a file that descrip the implementation of how serverside and client communicate
when user login the main page: '/'

-> render will send the necessary code to client side, the angularJS code

then, every thing is done in the clientside, using the angularJS

(angularJS will handle the user action, including the request of the database, put...)

The server doesn't communicate with user directly using the ejs render, because of server load

the route in server will used to only responds to angularJS requests.

that's all, we use angualrJS as the local application
