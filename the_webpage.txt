How each webpage is linked and the allowed query url is here:

I think it's better to be one page application

main page : /
get: return a list of shrot articles from post collection
each item contains a picture, a title and a short description

post: post the upvote thing

------------------------------
detail view: /post/url...
get: return a article from post collection specified by the url
post: is forbidden
